If you would like to help translate Infinity And Beyond, head over to our [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/deeper-and-darker) page. If there is a language you want to add translations for, but it is not listed on the page, start a discussion on Crowdin or join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/3QNhsQFp)! I'd love to make our mod even more accessible.

We accept bug fixes from the community; however, the majority of development is done internally by me myself. Be sure to use proper naming conventions and match the organization of the mod's workspace if you want to make changes!
